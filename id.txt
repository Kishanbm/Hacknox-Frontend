Backend Update: Multi-Hackathon Architecture Migration
1. Executive Summary
Refactored the backend to support multiple concurrent hackathons instead of a single global event.
Previously, the app assumed a single global event. Now, every dashboard (Participant, Judge, and Admin) must operate within the context of a specific hackathon_id.
The Global Requirement: All API calls to resource endpoints (Teams, Submissions, Assignments, Evaluations) must now include a hackathon_id as a query parameter or header.

2. The "New Rule" (Breaking Change)
Every single API call related to a specific event (Dashboard, Teams, Submissions, Judging) MUST now include the selected Hackathon ID in the headers.
Action Required: Update your global axios or fetch interceptor to inject this header automatically once the user selects an event.
JavaScript
// Example Header Injection
config.headers['x-hackathon-id'] = selectedHackathonId; // From LocalStorage/Context

If this header is missing, the API will return 400 Bad Request or 403 Forbidden.

3. Phase 1: Participant Portal Updates
A. New "Discover Hackathons" Page (The Entry Point)
Users can no longer land directly on the "Dashboard". They must first choose an event.
New Route: /participant/discover (or make this the home /participant landing).
New API: GET /api/public/hackathons/active
UI Requirement:
Display a grid/list of active hackathons.
Show details: Name, Deadline, Max Team Size.
Action: When clicked, save the hackathon.id to Global Context/LocalStorage and redirect to /participant/dashboard.
B. Dashboard & Team Pages (Scoped Data)
No UI Changes needed, but Logic Change required.
Update: Ensure the GET /api/participant/dashboard call includes the x-hackathon-id header.
Result: The backend will now return data only for that specific event.
Team Creation/Join:
The backend now automatically links the new team to the active hackathon_id from the header. You don't need to send it in the body, just ensure the header is present.

4. Phase 2: Admin Portal Updates
Admins can now manage multiple events. The global "Admin Dashboard" is now a "Hackathon Manager".
A. New "My Hackathons" Dashboard
New Route: /admin/hackathons
New API: GET /api/admin/hackathons/my-hackathons
UI Requirement: A list of events this admin owns.
"Create New" Button: Calls POST /api/admin/hackathons (Body: { name, submission_deadline, max_team_size }).
Action: Clicking an event enters "Manager Mode" (sets the hackathon_id context).
B. "Manager Mode" (Existing Pages)
Once inside an event (e.g., managing "Winter Hack 2024"):
Existing Tabs (Teams, Judges, Stats): No UI changes.
Logic Change: Ensure all these existing admin API calls send the x-hackathon-id header.
Result: The Team List will now only show teams for "Winter Hack 2024", not every team in the database.

5. Phase 3: Judge Portal Updates
Judges are no longer global; they are assigned to specific events.
A. New "My Judging Events" List
New Route: /judge/events
New API: GET /api/judge/events
UI Requirement: Show cards for events where the user is an assigned Judge.
Action: Clicking an event sets the context and redirects to the Worklist.
B. The Worklist (Assignments)
API Update: GET /api/judge/assignments now requires the header.
Behavior: It will return only the teams assigned to the judge for that specific event. Cross-event pollution is fixed on the backend.

 Migration Checklist for Frontend 
[ ] State Management: Create a Global Context to store activeHackathonId.
[ ] Interceptor: Configure Axios to auto-inject x-hackathon-id if the ID exists in state.
[ ] New Page: Build the "Discover Hackathons" card grid for Participants.
[ ] New Page: Build the "My Hackathons" list for Admins.
[ ] New Page: Build the "Judging Events" list for Judges.
[ ] Testing: Verify that switching events refreshes the dashboard data correctly.


 The Frontend "State" Flow
Selection: User picks a hackathon on the "Discover" page.
Storage: The Frontend saves that id in Local Storage or React Context.
Automatic Injection: Every time the dev calls api.get('/dashboard'), their code automatically pulls the ID from storage and attaches it to the request.
Backend Receipt: Your middleware requireHackathonId catches that ID and filters the database.
